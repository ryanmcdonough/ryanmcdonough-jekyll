Last month we relaunched PlexusLaw.co.uk, one of the main brochure websites we have at Parabis.Â I took it from a static layout of two columns on every page, no matter the page requirements, to something much more fluid and dynamic.

The base of the website was built with Bootstrap, the fantastic framework from the guys at twitter. However unlike most bootstrap websites which you can tell are based on bootstrap at a glace, this website would have a lot of customisation.

[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66" alt="Plexus Law" src="http://www.ryanmcdonough.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Plexus-Law-300x283.png" width="300" height="283" srcset="https://www.ryanmcdonough.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Plexus-Law-300x283.png 300w, https://www.ryanmcdonough.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Plexus-Law-1024x968.png 1024w, https://www.ryanmcdonough.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Plexus-Law.png 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.ryanmcdonough.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Plexus-Law.png)

As you can see from the above screenshot it&#8217;s hard to recognise that bootstrap. was even used. However it does retain the beautiful responsive nature of bootstrap, allowing the site to work perfectly on all devices.
