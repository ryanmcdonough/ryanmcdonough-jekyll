I have recently updated [Hashfor.me](https://hashfor.me) in the past two weeks. With new hashes available for generating; I have also included the ability to generate Pseudo Random Numbers as well as the ability to detect hashes. Both of these new features make use of plugins I created, [jQuery.HashIdentity](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/JQuery.HashIdentity) and [jQuery.uheprnGen](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/jQuery.uheprnGen) respectively.  You can [download/fork/contribute the code on Github](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/hashgenerator).
