So yesterday I released [hullstrap 0.2](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/hullstrap), hullstrap being an instance of [hull.io](http://hull.io)Â themed with bootstrap and some extra custom stylings.

It provides widgets for:

  * Identity (Full page & compact button)
  * Friends (Full page & compact friends list)
  * Comments and Commenting (On activities)
  * Activity (Full page & compact list)
  * Lists (Full page)
  * Share & Like Buttons

Hopefully making customising hull a little easier for new people.

Though of course you are wondering what hull is? Hull is a pretty cool service allowing you to create social apps in a weekend.

> hull is a full stack social platform as a service. It makes it easy for developers to build social apps with open and reusable components.

Basically taking the effort out of connecting to github, twitter or facebook and taking advantage of those services as well as making your site social in an instant.

Download [hullstrap from Github](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/hullstrap), or have a look at the [demo](http://ryanmcdonough.co.uk/hullstrap/index.html).
