These sites seem to get quite popular, http://isthatcherdeadyet.co.uk &#8211; case in point.

So I quickly wrote a small JS app that would check my twitter feed and check to see if I had posted anything in the past two days, if not then I&#8217;m dead.

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/Am-I-Dead-Yet), and the full version of my site is at:Â [isryanmcdonoughdeadyet.co.uk](http://isryanmcdonoughdeadyet.co.uk "Is Ryan McDonough Dead Yet?")
