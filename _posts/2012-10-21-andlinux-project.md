[What a great project, ](http://andlinux.org/)a full Ubuntu system within Windows. Coming in XFCE and KDE flavours, you get:

  * A fully functional Linux system, however without the usual desktop (you already have one from Windows)
  * A second Xfce panel e.g. at the top of your Windows desktop, from which you can start Linux applications.
  * Linux applications and Windows applications can be used simultaneously and you can cut and paste text between them, pipes (a Windows application writes something into a Linux application) do work as well.
  * Synaptic to install further applications. Synaptic on Windows – why did no-one think of this before?!

This is a great system for those must have Linux app’s you have to use when you have to use a Windows system, this is obviously for people who use Linux already and have to use Windows in some aspect of their life for either work on an application that Wine can’t quite do just yet.
