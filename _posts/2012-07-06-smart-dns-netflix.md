Whilst looking for a router I could set up as VPN gateway to the US to access the larger library of content they have available on Netflix, I landed upon [OverPlay](https://www.overplay.net/#a_aid=4284552665).net I signed up for a full VPN account, with access to Smart DNS.

Smart DNS allows you resolve the American Netflix, by only changing your DNS records. This is useful as most devices that allow you to use Netflix, which may not necessarily have full VPN support will allow you to change your DNS records. Allowing you to keep your full speed from your ISP, and not having to tunnel through a VPN for a service that doesn&#8217;t require encryption.

To Quote [OverPlay](https://www.overplay.net/#a_aid=4284552665):

> By enabling the SmartDNS service on your OverPlay account (visit the My Account area of our website, and choose the Server Details tab) and then performing the incredibly simple configuration change, you’ll instantly enable access to websites currently blocked at your office, school, or location. With no software to install, it even works on connected devices – iPads, AppleTVs, roku or BoxeeBox… the list is endless! Furthermore, if you make the simple configuration change on your local router, you’ll even benefit from the SmartDNS service on your entire network.
> 
> Please note that this service differs from our standard offering in a few ways. Firstly, this isn’t a VPN! It doesn’t encrypt traffic, everything still goes via your ISP. Don’t use this service if you need the extra safety provided by the VPN! Second, unlike the VPN service, the supported websites are whitelisted – obscure sites may not yet be supported, and others simply may not be compatible. Don’t worry though, if SmartDNS doesn’t unblock, you can fall back to our standard VPN service!
