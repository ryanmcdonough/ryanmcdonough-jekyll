Today I have released an update for my Crowd SSO interface for C# &#8211; it involved making it more DRY.

You can find the code over on [Github: https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/CrowdSSO](https://github.com/ryanmcdonough/CrowdSSO)

Features include:

  * Authentication
  * Change Password
  * Update Password
  * Retrieve User Detail
  * Retrieve User Attributes
  * Retrieve Users In Group
