In the past few years you will have seen more and more news about items like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" target="_blank">SOPA</a> & the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy_Act_2010" target="_blank">Digital Economy Act</a> which were attempts to curb your privacy and rights online by using piracy, child pornography and terrorism as guises to try and push these through.

Even without these recently in the UK the courts have decided that 5 major ISPs must block the piratebay, and thus ending all piracy.

However, these blocks can be circumvented **easily** and **securely** using VPNs. There are other guides online to using proxies, however they are not as safe as using a private VPN service.

A VPN allows you to tunnel all your traffic from your device to a server elsewhere using SSL allowing you to totally hide your traffic from your ISP, and making it appear to any sites or services that use that you are coming from the server, rather than your specific device (and it&#8217;s associated IP address).

## Step 1 &#8211; Signing up for a VPN service

I would suggest using a service like <a href="http://www.yourprivatevpn.com/" target="_blank">http://yourprivatevpn.com</a>, there are 3 packages you can choose from depending on your requirements.

  * Silver provides 2mb download speed, useful for streaming iplayer & general internet usage.
  * Gold provides 6mb download speed, useful for HD streaming and big downloads
  * Premium provides unlimited download speed (50mb), useful for those heavy downloaders among you.

## Step 2 &#8211; Using the service

YourPrivateVPN comes with a tool for windows and guides for Mac & Linux on how to use the VPN, however the main features are servers in 6 countries (UK, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, America & Canada) which allow you to seem to be coming from these countries and helps further anonymise your browsing.

You should use the VPN when doing any browsing that you feel would be looked unfavourable upon by your ISP or the government. By using the VPN none of your traffic is seen by your ISP and therefore can&#8217;t be blocked, shape or monitored.

So by using a VPN on Virgin Internet you can visit thepiratebay.se or any other site the British Government and court system decides isn&#8217;t in its interest.

_When this type of stuff happens in China or Libya it&#8217;s called oppression._

Ideas when to use a VPN:

  * <span style="line-height: 21px;">When using free internet in places like Starbucks, McDonalds, Airports</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 21px;">When using paid for internet in hotels or abroad and are unaware of who is looking at your browsing habits.</span>
